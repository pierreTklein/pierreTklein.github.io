                  to the outside world? Probably more than you think. With the
                  rise of microservices and complex systems, service owners are
                  less aware of the critical user journeys depending on their
                  systems. In this talk, you will learn about a simple yet
                  powerful application of OpenTelemetry to find and fix major
                  serving outages before they occur. I will also share several
                  high risk dependencies within Google Maps that we caught by
                  using this tool.

                  >Want to prevent outages before they happen? Traditional SRE
                  methods focus on component failures, but a whole class of
                  outages stem from unexpected system interactions. We found a
                  solution. In our team, we use Systems Theoretic Process
                  Analysis (STPA) to identify and fix system-level
                  vulnerabilities before they cause outages. By applying STPA
                  during the design phase, we've prevented major incidents and
                  saved countless engineering hours. This talk will show you how
                  STPA can transform your approach to reliability. We'll share a
                  real-world example where STPA caught critical design flaws
                  that traditional methods missed, saving us months of costly
                  rework. Don't wait for outages to happen. Learn how STPA can
                  help you build more resilient systems and become a 1000x
                  engineer.
